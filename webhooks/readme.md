 ## Introduction

Allthings uses webhooks to notify you when an event happens in an App. Webhooks are useful when you want to react to certain events occurring within an App like synchronizing ticketing data between Allthings and a 3rd-party ticketing tool or keeping ERP systems up to date with changes to tenant data. Webhooks are particularly useful for extending the Allthings platform with 3rd-party integrations and partners.


### What are webhooks

_Webhooks_ refers to a combination of technologies tied together so that collectively they create a notification and reaction system. Webhooks allow App administrators, partners, and 3rd-party developers to augment or enhance the Allthings Platform with additional custom behaviors and functionality.

You can think of a webhook a little bit like a phone call. You share with us your phone number, and whenever there is activity in your App, we call your phone number to share that information with you.
